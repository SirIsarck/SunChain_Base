## SunChain — Decentralized Solar Energy Network on Base

Built on: Base (Ethereum L2)
Category: DePIN / Energy Infrastructure
Stage: Pre-pilot Planning & Architecture
Team Lead: Isarck Eser (SunChain)

## Problem

Over 600M Africans lack reliable electricity access.

# Key challenges:

- Grid power is expensive, unstable, and centralized
- Rural communities rely on generators with high fuel cost
- Energy billing lacks transparency and trust
- Community micro-grids struggle with revenue coordination
- Operators have no reliable data for maintenance or planning

There is no open infrastructure that:
tracks energy usage transparently
automates billing and payments
enables trust among users, operators, and contributors

## Solution — SunChain on Base

SunChain is a DePIN community energy network that connects solar hubs to smart meters and records verified energy usage on-chain on Base.
Our system provides:

- Transparent, tamper-resistant usage records
- Stablecoin micro-payments via smart contracts
- Automated revenue sharing among stakeholders
- Offline-first metering for rural communities
- SunChain demonstrates a utility-driven DePIN model, where value is created from real-world energy services.

## Why Build on Base

Base offers:
- Low-cost micro-transactions for energy billing
- Ethereum-secured settlement
Supportive DePIN ecosystem
- Scalability for multi-community deployments
- Developer-friendly infrastructure and analytics

Base allows SunChain to:

* anchor meter identity and data proofs on-chain
* automate stablecoin billing and settlement
* enable transparent community revenue distribution


## How the Smart Meter & IoT System Works

Operational Architecture

1. Smart hub meter measures:
user energy consumption
uptime & load performance
battery and distribution status
2. Data is processed by local AI agent:
anomaly detection
predictive maintenance flags
per-user billing logic
3. When connectivity is available:
aggregated data summary is hashed
proof is submitted on Base
4. Smart contract verifies:
timestamp
meter identity
data integrity
5. Billing + revenue share is executed automatically.

System supports offline operation, with sync-later capability.


## Reward & Incentive Model (Utility-First)

SunChain does not launch a token at pilot stage.

Incentives are based on:

* node uptime & reliability
* validated energy contribution
* data accuracy & performance

Revenue share beneficiaries:

* Hub operator
* Maintenance team
* Community partners / backers

Payments are executed via escrow-based smart contracts on Base.

All records are auditable and provable.


## Planned Pilot Targets (Pre-Deployment)

Current status: planning & technical preparation

Target outcomes for pilot phase:

- Deploy solar hubs across 3 pilot communities
- Onboard 100+ early users
- Achieve ≥80% reliability uptime
- Achieve ≥70% automated data sync success
- Validate billing + settlement workflow on Base

Pilot evaluation will inform scale-out decisions.


## Grant Request

Amount Requested: $5,000

Allocation

* IoT meter hardware prototyping & enclosure design
* Smart contract refinement & security review
* AI agent firmware + data integrity checks
* Operator dashboard & monitoring tools

This grant accelerates field-ready pilot development and proof-of-adoption.


## Security & Reliability Approach

* Meter identity registry on Base
* Signed + timestamped energy reading proofs
* Escrow settlement for payments
* Human-in-loop dispute fallback
* External audit prior to large-scale rollout

Safety focus: accuracy, reliability, transparency.
